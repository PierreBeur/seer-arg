          SEER report.
          <br>
          A week has gone by since the war came to an end. Since we lost and shamefully surrendered to those Floreran dogs. My sister, Belladonna, insists to me that this was a victory. That through “peace” both of our nations can move forward. My sister is a childish idiot. She acts as if she won us a piece of territory for our nation, instead, it's just a prison to keep us out of their lands. Resources we could use to fuel our nation, our glorious Milvus, behind a border we can no longer venture out into. I wonder what The Nest thinks of our failures. No. Of hers. 
          <br>
          I was leading us to victory and leading our people to glorious lands made for us. I stormed the beaches of Florera, sending that great wolf of theirs running. Then I found and tracked down that traitor Olvario. I beat him dead! Not Her. I would've kept that momentum all the way to the deserts Mazin if it wasn't for that boy. I didn't even see him. He got me while I was putting that dog down. It all went black. When I awoke I was missing an eye and Belladonna had taken control of my men and ordered them to stand down and surrender to our enemies. To hand over our weapons to them. She's left us powerless.
          <br>
          I'm being escorted back home to Milvus by her command. Belladonna says this is for my safety, but I know my other half too well. She doesn't want me in her way. I plan to meet with The Nest to discuss our next course of action. They would disagree with her surrender, I know it.
          <br>
          We are Hagens. We do not kneel. We soar.

          Belladonna log 1.
          <br>
          It's been a week since I ended it. The three hundred long years of fight, all the bloodshed and destruction my family had brought to this land. I ended it all as peacefully as I could with the help of Florera's leader, and newly risen Wolf of Florera, Omar Vale. He and I met privately to discuss a solution to the war, to end the suffering of both nation's people. He was hesitant to meet, but after seeing how Olvario, the rebel leader, was begging to spiral after his wife's death he was willing to meet and hear me out.
          <br>
          I told Omar everything I knew about SEER's plans, their military tactics, and their weapons. My brother Ryan had planned on weaponizing a virus in The Aether known as Nullification. He wanted to turn all those people into monsters. When I brought this up with Omar I saw the horror in his face. We both agreed a weapon like that would bring only destruction not to Florera but to the whole Aether.
          <br>
          Omar and I forged a plan. We could limit most of SEER's forces and powers with all the information I provided. However, my brother was one step ahead of me. He had infected the people of Amberfield with the Nullification and destroyed the small town of Amberfield. I was too late to stop him. When I arrived in Amberfield the city was in ruins infested by nulls. I arrived to see my brother on the floor bathing in his blood. He was missing an eye. His men aimed at a child with a rifle. I made them stand down and retrieve the boy. The boy was Alarico, the son of Olvario and with help from Omar, we reunited the boy with his siblings.
          <br>
          The next day Omar would introduce the King of The Aether, Flynt Alwyn, a frighting powerful man. The three of us met privately to propose a peace treaty between The Aether and Milvus, wanting to ensure the horrors from that night never happened again. The plan is to trade resources, food, medicine, weapons, and technology to one another. King Flynt always wanted SEER to surrender all access to Nullification, promising that if we didn't he would personally visit Milvus and destroy everything. In return, we would also be given Amberfield and The eastern coast as territory to make trading easier between us. With no hesitation, I agreed. It's better this way.
          <br>
          This past week I've been helping clean up the destruction in Amberfield, trying to find any survivors hiding in the city, and also eliminate any remaining Nulls. In the destruction, I found a boy hiding in the ruins of an orphanage. Zale is his name and he has no parents, siblings, or any family. He said the orphanage has always been his home. I'm still trying to figure out his situation, but in the meantime, he is sticking close to me. 
          <br>
          Recently I informed The Nest of the outcome. At first, they were upset, but after bringing up the threats made by Flynt they came to an understanding. I know they aren't happy with the deal and probably are already making plans without my knowledge, but if this treaty is successful and beneficial then they will in time come to terms with the situation. 
          <br>
          There is still so much work to be done here so I can't return home yet. safety. But my brother Ryan will. I fear many of the citizens of Florera may want to take it upon themselves to end his life for all the suffering and destruction he brought them, so for his safety he will be escorted back to Milvus. If he dies here then it would just spark more conflict.
          <br>
          Honestly, I'm worried about the deal. I don't know how long it will last or the conflicts it will spark, but I have to have faith. Faith in myself, Omar, and the peace I want to bring into the future. We've done enough damage to ourselves. It's time for us to heal.
